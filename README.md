# Data-Analyst-Projects
Collection of project related to Data Analysis
* Project 1-Explore weather trends.
   * The goal in Project 1 was to analyze the local and the global temperature and discover some trends in the temperature data. I used SQL to get data from the database provided by Udacity.
* Project 2-Investigate a Dataset. 
   * In this project we analyzed the TMDb movie data provided by Udacity. This dataset consists of more than 10000 rows (movies) with 21 features (columns) associated with each movie. 
* Project 3-Analyze A/B test results
  * This project is focused on conduction of an A/B test. This test is very helpful on deciding whether a company should launch a new webpage or keep the old one for example.
* Project 4-Analyze A/B test results. 
  * The main bulk of this project had to do with wrangling data (gather, assess, clean). Tha data was collected from multiple sources. All the steps of wrangling process and vidualization are demonstrated in the notebook wrangle_act.ipynb. The report for this project can be found in the notebook wrangle_report.ipynb.
* Project 5-Communicate Data Findings. 
  *In this project we explored a dataset (saved in the file porsperLoanData.csv) of approximately 114000 loans lent to borrowers from investors via Prosper services. This dataset include investors' and borrowers' history (approximately 80 features) and borrowers' prosper score based on which the investors make their decisions. The main focus in this project was on visualizing data using libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn and finding correlations between features. The main analysis is demonstrated in the notebook exploration_propser_loan.ipynb
